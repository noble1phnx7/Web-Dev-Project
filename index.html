	<p style="color:white">Hello! My name is Rocky Smith II. This is my first time using HTML, 
	and it seems like it is an interesting way to do things. A little 
	bit about me, I am a prior service United States Marine. I originaly
 	studied at HCC until I got my associates in computer science, and 
	move over to UHD to finish my bachelors. I am looking forward to getting
	a simple job out in the world codding, and possibly in the future going on 
	to teach and pass on my knowledge. In my spare time one of my hobbies is 
	collaborative storytelling with my friends. I play dungeons and dragons and 
	we use dndbeyond as a reference site to track all of our games, the link is
	provided down below. The image provided is a picture from the source 
	material of the game,depicting an adventuring party preparing for combat. 
	I hope that one day I can have the opportunity to work with the developers 
	of dungeons and dragons. </p>
